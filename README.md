# Udacity data science nanodegree course
## _Introduction to data science end of module project_

## Theme

This project was run based on the data from tennis ATP games results. On top of games players, results or scores, the dataset used provides the betting odds that are used to understand if a simple gambling strategy can be used to ensure or maximize benefits.

## Contents

The project is composed of a simple jupyter notebook file. All comments are provided in it but, in a nutshell, it does:

- Import the data downloaded from 
- Check how reliable are the odds (is the player with the lowest value always winning ? hint: no)
- Study the correlation between the level of reliability of the odds and the type of tournament
- Analyze a gambling strategy for the four biggest tournaments (Grand Slams)

## Installation

Nothing special here, you just need a jupyter notebook instance running.
